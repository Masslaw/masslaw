# Gremlin Failure Causes Entire Application Failure

## Issue

A gremlin failure occurred, was uncaught and caused the entire application to fail.

## Desired Alternative

The gremlin failure should be caught and handled so that the application can continue to run.
Even if it means ignoring it, the optimal behavior may not be fully executed, but this is better 
than the entire application failing - causing other actions to fail and overall causing the entire case-file processing pipeline to fail

## Solution

We wrapped the gremlin action executions with a try/catch block and log the error.
